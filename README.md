 Project focusses on devloping a predictive maintenance model for industrial machinery. By analyzing sensor data and historical records, our solution predicts equipment failures before they occur. This proactive approach minimizes downtime, optimizes maintenance schedules, and reduces operational costs. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we train models to identify patterns indicative of potential failures. Evaluation ensures accuracy and reliability. It offers significant benefits including improved efficiency, reduced downtime, and enhanced safety. By harnessing data analytics and machine learning, we empower industries to achieve greater reliability and productivity in their operations.
